Summaries of No Agenda podcasts, and formatting tools for them

This project is "competing" with two other related-but-different
projects: [No Agenda Player](https://www.noagendaplayer.com/) and
the resurrection of [Read No Agenda](http://readnoagenda.com) at
[Fanscribed](https://www.fanscribed.com/podcasts/3-no-agenda/).
Both are excellent projects, and I hope to contribute to the
latter. In fact, I considered doing my own series of transcripts
as a way of exploring the history of No Agenda. But then I tried
to do it, and found out that's *real* work!

This project aims to be a resource that primarily answers the
question: "When did John and Adam play that great clip about
*[insert topic here]*?"

I will attempt to keep these current with new shows, and eventually
to do summaries back to the first one. Suggestions and corrections
will of course be welcomed.

Philosophy
--------
 
I play by a few loose rules, and am not particularly dogmatic about
enforcing them. They are:

1. The one I am fairly strict on is to keep my voice out of the summary.
   If I can't resist a humorous comment, or correction, it will
   be in parentheses.
  * This has the odd side-effect that these are not really "summaries",
     because I feel it's up to the reader to listen to Adam & John and
     draw conclusions based on what they're saying. I'm not here to
     give you the punch line, I'm here to tickle your memory.
     Corollary: this is not a substitute for The Real Thing.
2. I try to keep one timestamp per broad topic, but when there is
   a long-running discussion, or a clip of significance, I may
   give that a second timestamp.
3. Anything I quote Adam or John on, gets the ACC: or JCD: prefixes,
   respectively.
4. I try to separate related but distinct sections with a semicolon,
   within a timestamp section.
5. Compilation and interview shows will tend to show only macroscopic structure.
6. I try to keep these to exactly one page in general, with exceptions
   for oddball outliers and older, shorter shows.

Schedule
--------

I generally finish the Thursday show over the weekend and get it
online Monday. Typically the Sunday show goes up Wednesday. (I do
my first listen of new shows for enjoyment and to get the structure
in mind, so I almost never start summarizing new shows the first time
round.)

When I am on vacation (May, September, Thanksgiving, Christmas) I do
pen-and paper summaries, so it may seem that I have fallen behind.
Not so! I just don't have devices available that make that kind of
keyboard entry straightforward.

I recently changed my policy on squeezing in old shows by doing them
in reverse order. This is hard to do as context is lost. So I decided
to start with approximately the first show I ever heard (I subscribed
somewtime between Newtown and Boston) and work forward. When (and if)
I catch up, I'll possibly pick up at 200 and work forward, then (if I
have not died of old age, gone insane, or both) start from Show 1.
