Summaries of No Agenda podcasts, and formatting tools for them

This project is "competing" with two other related-but-different
projects: [No Agenda Player](https://www.noagendaplayer.com/) and
the resurrection of [Read No Agenda](http://readnoagenda.com) at
[Fanscribed](https://www.fanscribed.com/podcasts/3-no-agenda/).
Both are excellent projects, and I hope to contribute to the
latter. In fact, I considered doing my own series of transcripts
as a way of exploring the history of No Agenda. But then I tried
to do it, and found out that's *real* work!

This project aims to be a resource that primarily answers the
question: "When did John and Adam play that great clip about
*[insert topic here]*?"

I will attempt to keep these current with new shows, and eventually
to do summaries back to the first one. Suggestions and corrections
will of course be welcomed.

Philosophy
--------
 
I play by a few loose rules, and am not particularly dogmatic about
enforcing them. They are:

1. The one I am fairly strict on is to keep my voice out of the text.
   If I can't resist a humorous comment, or correction, it will
   be in parentheses.
  * This has the odd side-effect that these are not really "summaries",
     because I feel it's up to the reader to listen to Adam & John and
     draw conclusions based on what they're saying. I'm not really here to
     give you the punch line, I'm here to tickle your memory.
     Corollary: this is not a substitute for The Real Thing.
2. I try to keep one timestamp per broad topic, but when there is
   a long-running discussion, or a clip of significance, I may
   give that a second timestamp.
3. Anything I quote Adam or John on, gets the ACC: or JCD: prefixes,
   respectively.
4. I try to separate related but distinct sections with a semicolon,
   within a timestamp section.
5. Compilation and interview shows will tend to show only macroscopic structure.
6. I try to keep these to exactly one page in general, with exceptions
   for oddball outliers, extremely information- and/or comedy-dense
   material (2016 election mayhem, for example) and the oldest shows.

Schedule
--------

*As of Spring 2017 I am working from Show 1 to Show 424 in parallel with current
material, so the schedule will be even dodgier than alluded to below.*

*Also, I now have a laptop I intend to use for keeping up when on vacation.
I kind of enjoyed the pen-and-paper routine -- it has been kind of a
tradition -- but the new laptop should make things a lot more efficient and
I will not have the January summary pileup to upload as in previous years*

I try to finish the Thursday show over the weekend and get it
online Monday. Typically the Sunday show goes up Wednesday. (I do
my first listen of new shows for enjoyment and to get the structure
in mind, so I almost never start summarizing new shows the first time
round.) I frequently deviate from this schedule, however.

When I am on vacation (May, September, Thanksgiving, Christmas) I do
pen-and paper summaries, so it may seem that I have fallen behind.
Not so! I just don't have devices available that make that kind of
keyboard entry straightforward.
