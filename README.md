NASummaries
===========

Hosted at [callclooney.org](http://callclooney.org)

Book-length summaries of *No Agenda* podcast (also known as The Best Podcast
in the Universe), and formatting tools for them.

Origin of the Project
--------

I began listening to *No Agenda* toward the beginning of 2013 on the
recommendation of a now-man-overboard coworker. This was in the days of
the FBI Six-Week Cycle, out-of-control TSA shenanigans, and Constitution-hating
Democrat gun-grabbers crawling out of the woodwork in the aftermath
of Sandy Hook.

I was inspired in 2014, at the mention of -- on Show 518, I believe --
summaries of the very earliest shows by KD "Bubba" Martin,
to consider doing my own series of transcripts
as a way of exploring the history of *No Agenda*. An early pilot project
convinced that such task would be insurmountable via solo effort, after
three hours of work on Show 10. So I decided to shoot for
a bronze medal instead.

This project aims to be a resource that primarily answers the
question: "When did John and Adam play that great clip about
*[insert topic here]*?"

Suggestions and corrections will of course be welcomed. I often fail to get
the timestamp for the opening one-liner, so anyone who can cough one of those
up will be heartily congratulated.

Licensing
--------

*I hereby place the source code in the public domain.*

Philosophy
--------
 
I play by a few loose rules, and am not particularly dogmatic about
enforcing them. They are:

1. The one I am fairly strict on is to keep my voice out of the text.
   If I can't resist a humorous comment, or correction, it will
   be in parentheses.
  * This has the odd side-effect that these are not really "summaries",
     because I feel it's up to the reader to listen to Adam & John and
     draw conclusions based on what they're saying. I'm not really here to
     give you the punch line, I'm here to tickle your memory.
     Corollary: this is not a substitute for The Real Thing.
2. I try to keep one timestamp per broad topic, but when there is
   a long-running discussion, or a clip of significance, I may
   give that a second timestamp.
3. Anything I quote Adam or John on, gets the ACC: or JCD: prefixes,
   respectively.
4. I try to separate related but distinct sections with a semicolon,
   within a timestamp section.
5. Compilation shows will tend to show only macroscopic structure.
6. I try to keep these to exactly one page in general, with exceptions
   for oddball outliers, extremely information- and/or comedy-dense
   material (2016 election mayhem, for example) and the oldest shows.

Schedule
--------

*As of Spring 2017 I am working from Show 1 to Show 424 in parallel with current
material, so the schedule will be even dodgier than alluded to below.*

*Also, I now have a laptop I intend to use for keeping up when on vacation.
I kind of enjoyed the pen-and-paper routine -- it has been kind of a
tradition -- but the new laptop should make things a lot more efficient and
I will not have the January summary pileup to upload as in previous years*

I try to finish the Thursday show over the weekend and get it
online Monday. Typically the Sunday show goes up Wednesday. (I do
my first listen of new shows for enjoyment and to get the structure
in mind, so I almost never start summarizing new shows the first time
round.) I frequently deviate from this schedule, however.

When I am on vacation (May, September, Thanksgiving, Christmas) I do
pen-and paper summaries, so it may seem that I have fallen behind.
Not so! I just don't have devices available that make that kind of
keyboard entry straightforward.

Will This Work Ever be Available in Hardcopy?
---------------------------------------------

I intend to self-publish this eventually, after the early shows are finished
and I have a straight run of Shows 1-1300 (and beyond).
