Summaries of No Agenda podcasts, and formatting tools for them

Unfortunately, the No Agenda transcript project ran out of steam.
Transcripts would, naturally, be better than summaries, but the
effort required to do them accurately and completely would be
far more than I could manage alone. This effort, then, is a
compromise. I hope it will be useful to No Agenda fans.

I will attempt to keep these current with new shows, and eventually
to do summaries back to the first one. Suggestions and corrections
will of course be welcomed.

Philosophy
--------
 
I play by a few loose rules, and am not particularly dogmatic about
enforcing them. They are:

1. The one I am fairly strict on is to keep my voice out of the summary.
   If I can't resist a humorous comment, or correction, it will
   be in parentheses.
  * This has the odd side-effect that these are not really "summaries",
     because I feel it's up to the reader to listen to Adam & John and
     draw conclusions based on what they're saying. I'm not here to
     give you the punch line, I'm here to tickle your memory.
     Corollary: this is not a substitute for the Real Thing.
2. I try to keep one timestamp per broad topic, but when there is
   a long-running discussion, or a clip of significance, I may
   give that a second timestamp.
3. Anything I quote Adam or John on, gets the ACC: or JCD: prefixes,
   respectively.
4. I try to separate related but distinct sections with a semicolon,
   within a timestamp section.

Schedule
--------

I generally finish the Thursday show over the weekend and get it
online Monday. Typically the Sunday show does up Wednesday. (I do
my first listen of new shows for enjoyment and to get the structure
in mind, so I almost never start summarizing new shows the first time
round.)

When I am on vacation (May, September, Thanksgiving, Christmas) I do
pen-and paper summaries, so it may seem that I have fallen behind.
Not so! I just don't have devices available that make that kind of
keyboard entry straightforward.
