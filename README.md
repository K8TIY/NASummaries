Summaries of No Agenda podcasts, and formatting tools for them

Unfortunately, the No Agenda transcript project ran out of steam.
Transcripts would, naturally, be better than summaries, but the
effort required to do them accurately and completely would be
far more than I could manage alone. This effort, then, is a
compromise. I hope it will be useful to No Agenda fans.

I will attempt to keep these current with new shows, and eventually
to do summaries back to the first one. Suggestions and corrections
will of course be welcomed.
