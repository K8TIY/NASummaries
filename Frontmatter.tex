\textbf{Origin of the Project}\\

I began listening to \textit{No Agenda} toward the beginning of 2013 on the
recommendation of a now-man-overboard coworker. This was in the days of
the FBI Six-Week Cycle, out-of-control TSA shenanigans, and Constitution-hating
Democrat gun-grabbers crawling out of the woodwork in the aftermath
of Sandy Hook.\\

I was inspired in 2014, at the mention of -- on Show 518, I believe --
summaries of the very earliest shows by KD ``Bubba" Martin,
to consider doing my own series of transcripts
as a way of exploring the history of \textit{No Agenda}. An early pilot project
convinced that such task would be insurmountable via solo effort, after
three hours of work on Show 10. So I decided to shoot for
a bronze medal instead.\\

This project aims to be a resource that at least partially answers the
questions ``when did John and Adam play that funny clip about
\textit{[insert topic here]}?", and ``how did that funny
\textit{[insert meme here]} thing get started?"
I'm not really here to give you the punch line, I'm here to tickle your memory.
In simplest terms: this is not a substitute for The Real Thing.\\

Suggestions and corrections will of course be welcomed. I often fail to get
the timestamp for the opening one-liner, so anyone who can cough one of those
up will be heartily congratulated.
